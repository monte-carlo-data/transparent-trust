SKILL LIBRARY PHILOSOPHY:
- Build a compact knowledge base of 15-30 comprehensive skills, NOT 100+ narrow ones
- Think of skills like chapters in a book, not individual pages
- Skills should cover BROAD CAPABILITY AREAS: 'Security & Compliance', 'Data Platform', 'Integrations & APIs'

CONSOLIDATION BIAS:
- STRONGLY prefer updating existing skills over creating new ones
- Only create a new skill if content is genuinely unrelated to ALL existing skills
- A 'Security' skill absorbs encryption, access control, compliance content
- An 'Integrations' skill absorbs APIs, webhooks, SSO, authentication content
