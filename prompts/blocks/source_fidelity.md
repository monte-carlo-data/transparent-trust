SOURCE FIDELITY (CRITICAL):
- ONLY include information directly found in the provided sources
- DO NOT fabricate, hallucinate, or infer technical details not explicitly stated
- When a source says 'we have X', don't expand it into implementation specifics
- Rich sources produce rich content; sparse sources produce brief content
- It's better to be accurate and brief than padded with assumptions
